  Space capsule
  A space capsule is an often-crewed spacecraft that uses a blunt-body reentry 
  capsule to reenter the { "Earth's" } atmosphere without wings. Our capsule is where 
  { "you'll" } spend your time during the flight. It includes a space gym, cinema, 
  and plenty of other activities to keep you entertained and moody.
